# Week 4 Study Plan for STM32/Nucleo Projects

## Overview
This Week 4 plan builds on previous weeks, focusing on integrating multiple STM32 peripherals and creating more advanced projects.

| **Day** | **Topics to Cover** | **Detailed Description** |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| **Day 1** | 📊 **SD Card Interface (SPI/SDIO)** | Learn to interface an SD card, configure via *STM32CubeMX*, and log data to files. |
| **Day 2** | 💾 **EEPROM Interface (I2C)** | Study EEPROM basics, configure I2C, and write/read data from EEPROM. |
| **Day 3** | 📡 **Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Module (ESP8266/HC-05)** | Interface ESP8266 via UART or HC-05 via Bluetooth and send sensor data to a server. |
| **Day 4** | 📈 **Graphical Display (OLED/LCD)** | Interface an OLED/LCD display via I2C/SPI and display real-time sensor data. |
| **Day 5** | 🌐 **MQTT Communication** | Learn the MQTT protocol and send sensor data to a cloud platform via ESP8266. |
| **Day 6** | 🔧 **Error Handling and Debugging Techniques** | Implement error handling (e.g., watchdog resets, fault detection) and use STM32 debugging tools. |
| **Day 7** | 📝 **Final Integrated Project** | Combine learned modules into a smart data logger with display, cloud integration, and local storage. |
