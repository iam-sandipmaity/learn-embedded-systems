# Week 3 Study Plan for STM32/Nucleo Projects

## Overview
This 7-day study plan for Week 3 builds on Weeks 1 and 2, focusing on advanced STM32 features with practical projects.

| **Day** | **Topics to Cover** | **Detailed Description** |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| **Day 1** | 🖥️ **DMA (Direct Memory Access)** | Learn DMA basics, configure with *STM32CubeMX*, and perform data transfers without CPU intervention. |
| **Day 2** | 🛡️ **Watchdog Timers (IWDG, WWDG)** | Study watchdog types, configure using *STM32CubeMX*, and implement a system reset on timeout. |
| **Day 3** | 📊 **RTC (Real-Time Clock)** | Configure the RTC with *STM32CubeMX* and display date/time via UART. Save settings to backup registers. |
| **Day 4** | 🌐 **CAN Bus Communication** | Study the CAN protocol, configure a CAN node with *STM32CubeMX*, and simulate communication. |
| **Day 5** | 📡 **Low-Power Modes** | Explore STM32 low-power modes, configure Sleep/Stop/Standby modes, and measure power consumption. |
| **Day 6** | 🔒 **Bootloader and Firmware Update** | Learn about STM32 bootloaders, configure a UART bootloader, and perform a firmware upgrade. |
| **Day 7** | 📝 **Review and Advanced Project** | Build an integrated project (e.g., temperature logger with RTC, stored in memory, sent via UART). |
