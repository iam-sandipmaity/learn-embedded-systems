## üìí Explanation
- **Day 1-2:** Gain theoretical knowledge of RTOS concepts and integrate FreeRTOS into the STM32 project.
- **Day 3:** Create tasks with different priorities to understand task scheduling.
- **Day 4:** Implement queues for inter-task communication.
- **Day 5:** Use semaphores and mutexes to prevent race conditions and synchronize tasks.
- **Day 6:** Work with software timers to schedule repetitive tasks.
- **Day 7:** Review and document the week‚Äôs learning and projects.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Resources:
- **STM32CubeIDE:** Primary development and debugging environment  
- **FreeRTOS:** Real-Time Operating System Middleware  
- **Nucleo-G474 Board:** Practical hardware platform

This week builds a strong foundation in RTOS, a key skill for multitasking and real-time embedded applications. üöÄ
