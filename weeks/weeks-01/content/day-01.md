## 🧠 Theoretical Overview

### 🛠️ Introduction

Think of an embedded system as a small computer that does one specific job really well. You can find them everywhere - in your microwave that heats food, your TV remote that changes channels, or even traffic lights that control traffic. 

STM32 microcontrollers are like the "brain" of these embedded systems. They are small chips made by a company called STMicroelectronics that are very good at controlling different devices and machines.

In this lesson, we'll learn the basics of embedded systems and explore the STM32 family of microcontrollers in a simple way.


## 🖥️ What is an Embedded System?

**Definition**: An embedded system is a microcontroller or microprocessor-based computing system designed to perform dedicated functions within a larger mechanical or electrical system.

An embedded system is a specialized combination of hardware, software and firmware designed to perform specific tasks or functions within a larger system. These systems are typically resource-constrained, requiring careful optimization of processing power, memory, and energy consumption while maintaining real-time performance requirements.

Unlike general-purpose computers that can run many different applications, embedded systems are purpose-built for particular applications - like a microwave controller or a car's engine management system. They are optimized for efficiency, reliability and real-time operation in their specific use case.

   - STM32 MCUs offer timers, interrupts, and DMA to support real-time applications.

2. **Low-Power Operation**:  
   - Many STM32 devices provide low-power modes to extend battery life in portable applications.

3. **Peripheral Integration**:  
   - STM32 microcontrollers integrate diverse peripherals such as ADCs, DACs, communication interfaces (I2C, SPI, UART, CAN), and advanced timers.

### 📖 Additional Insights

- STM32 microcontrollers support a wide range of applications, from simple sensor hubs to complex motor control and communication devices.
- Development tools like STM32CubeIDE and debugging capabilities such as SWD (Serial Wire Debug) facilitate development and testing.
